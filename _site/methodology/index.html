<h3 id="visualizing-distance-measure">Visualizing distance measure</h3>

<p>The following images are meant to give a visual example of how the
distance-weighted average price measures were computed for each county
in each year. The first figure uses Williamson County, TN, as an
example county. The population center coordinates are used as the
origin point for distance measures to sample schools.</p>

<p><img src="../images/general.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second figure shows the location of all public two-year colleges
in the area. The legend shows the average price of all public two-year
colleges in 2012 as well as the average price for similar colleges
only in Tennessee. These would be the unweighted average price for
Williamson County if it shared the same price as all US counties/
Tennessee counties, respectively.</p>

<p><img src="../images/schools2yr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The third figure shows how the geodesic distance measure links
Williamson County to all public four-year colleges (including those
not shown for clarity). The weighted average price for Williamson
County is changed as a function of this distance from the unweighted
average price. The final figure is similar to the one before except
that the sample of public two-year colleges is limited to those that
are in Tennessee.</p>

<h3 id="weighted-average-price-formulas">Weighted average price formulas</h3>

<p>The weighted average price (WAP) of college for each United States
county in the lower 48 in each year is computed using the following
formula:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">WAP_{iy} = \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\frac{g_{ik}\cdot price_{ky}}{\sum_{k =
1}^{K} g_{ik}}</script>

<p>where \(price_{ky}\) is cost of institution \(k\) in year \(y\) and \(g\)
         is a weight for each cell. The weight \(g\) is defined as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">g_{ik} = \Bigg(\frac{d_{ik}}{\sum_{k=1}^K d_{ik}}\Bigg)^{-r}</script>

<p>with \(d_{ik}\) as the geodesic distance in miles between the county
population centroid \(i\) and institution \(k\) and \(r\) as the
drop off rate of influence.</p>

<p>For every county in the sample across each sample year, we compute the
           geodesic distance to each postsecondary institution using
           the Vincenty computation formula in the R package
           <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=geosphere">geosphere</a>,
           creating an \(I \times K\) matrix where the sum of each
           row represents the total distance of all postsecondary
           institutions from the county and the fraction of each cell
           over the row total the proportional distance of each
           institution.  So that closer institutions carry more weight
           than farther ones, weights for each cell, \(g_{ik}\), are
           computed by dividing the inverse of the proportional
           distance by the row sum of the inverse proportional
           distances.  To change the rate at which distance has
           influence, the exponential term, \(r\), may be
           modified. At \(r = 1\), weights are a linear function of
           distance; when \(r &gt; 1\), weights exponentially decay as
           distance increases. As \(r\) increases, the cost of the
           nearest institutions are up-weighted. In the limit, \(r
           \rightarrow \infty\), all weight will be placed on the
           nearest institution. We use a rate of \(r = 2\) to
           compute weights used to adjust the college price values for
           the interactive maps.</p>

<p>To compute the weighted average price for each county in each year,
          \(WAP_{iy}\), these weights are applied to a vector of
          yearly institutional costs, \(price_{ky}\), that are taken
          from IPEDS, and summed with that year. This results in an
          average postsecondary price for each county in each year. We
          repeat this process for different samples of schools: all
          Title IV schools, all public schools, all pubic four-year
          schools, and all public two-year schools. These different
          samples are represented by the <strong>College sample</strong> dropdown
          menu on the interactive maps page. Within each school
          sample, we compute two sets of weights: one that allows
          out-of-state schools to figure in the weighted average price
          equation and another that limits the sample of schools to
          only those located in the same state as the county. These
          different computations are represented in the <strong>Weighting</strong>
          dropdown menu.</p>

<h3 id="data">Data</h3>

<h4 id="united-states-census-bureau">United States Census Bureau</h4>

<p>County population center coordinates were taken from the 2000 and 2010
United States Census. Because our study period spans from 1997 to
2012, coordinates from the 2000 census were used for the years 1997 to
2005 while the 2012 coordinates were used for years thereafter.</p>

<h4 id="integrated-postsecondary-education-data-system-ipeds">Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)</h4>

<p>College coordinates and costs were taken from IPEDS variables for
published tuition in each year of the study period. In the case of
public institutions, the lower of in-state and in-district were
used. All dollar amounts are inflation-adjusted to 2013 dollars to
show the change in real dollars over time.</p>
